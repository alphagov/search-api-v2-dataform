# GOV.UK Search API v2 Dataform

## What's in this repo

This repo contains:

- [`definitions/`](definitions/): Google Dataform SQLX pipeline definitions for processing and transforming GA4 data into Google Verex AI Search datasets
- [`workflow_setting.yaml`](workflow_settings.yaml): Google Dataform workflow settings that apply to all pipelines

### What's not in this repo

Terraform definitions for dataform resources used to provision corresponding workflow and release configurations - [alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/deployments/search-api-v2/dataform.tf](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/deployments/search-api-v2/dataform.tf).

## Usage

Install the [Dataform CLI](https://cloud.google.com/dataform/docs/use-dataform-cli) for local development.

Currently no [Dataform Workspace](https://cloud.google.com/dataform/docs/workspaces) is established for Google Cloud Console based pipeline development - all development is performed locally before pushing progressively into each environment/branch. Each Search API v2 GCP project/environment has a seperate Dataform Release configuration which maps onto the corresponding branch (i.e. `integration`, `staging` etc.).

## Development and deployment workflow

1. Make changes in a feature branch.
2. Open a pull request to merge the feature branch into the `integration` branch. If the `integration` branch doesn't already exist, then create it first:

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b integration
git push
```

3. Merge the pull request.
4. Visit dataform in [integration](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/release-configurations/integration?project=search-api-v2-integration) and click the blue button "New compilation".
5. Click "Start execution" in [integration](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/details/release-scheduling?project=search-api-v2-integration), and choose the options in the form that pops up. Only those actions relevant to the changes you have made need be executed.

5. Check in the workflow execution logs in [integration](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/details/workflows?project=search-api-v2-integration) that the execution was successful.
6. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/search-api-v2-dataform/compare/staging...integration) to merge the `integration` branch into the `staging` branch. This pull request will include a merge commit from having merged the feature branch into the `integration` branch. If the `staging` branch doesn't already exist, then create it first:

```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b staging
git push
```

7. Merge the pull request.
8. Visit dataform in [staging](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/release-configurations/staging?project=search-api-v2-staging) and click the blue button "New compilation".
9. Click "Start execution" in [staging](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/details/release-scheduling?project=search-api-v2-staging), and choose similar options to the ones in step 5.
10. Check in the workflow execution logs in [staging](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/details/workflows?project=search-api-v2-staging) that the execution was successful.
11. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/search-api-v2-dataform/compare/main...staging) to merge the `staging` branch into the `main` branch. This pull request will include both merge commits from the previous pull requests.
12. Visit dataform in [production](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/release-configurations/production?project=search-api-v2-production) and click the blue button "New compilation".
13. Click "Start execution" in [production](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/details/release-scheduling?project=search-api-v2-production), and choose similar options to the ones in previous steps.
14. Check in the workflow execution logs in [production](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/search_api_v2/details/workflows?project=search-api-v2-production) that the execution was successful.
